# FYP-Project
This is our FYP Project. Our project consists of finding Main Events in the Sport Football(Soccer) and extract Timestamps of those events to Generate Highlight videos

## Our Approach
1. We will do this by finding Major Events which include

              •	Whenever a foul occurs (Red/Yellow Card)

              •	When a goal occurs

              •	When there is a near miss (Whenever the ball moves past the goal post)

2. We will then extract Timestamps of these Major Events

3. From the timestamps we will extract a clip where the major event occured

4. After all the clips have been extracted we will then render all of them together to generate highlights
